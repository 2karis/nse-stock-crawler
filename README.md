keeping up to date with stocks can be a haslte for investros, thats why my script does it for you. it allows you to gather the stock market data as you please
you need to use your brokerage account info to login.
it only works with cba's brokerage account 
it should in theory work with the other brokerage firms as well. but that would require some modificcation to the source code.
remember to update username and password in config
